dsTaskr is a "todo" web application written in PHP and Laravel. This was a great project which enabled me to get a refresher on the PHP language, MVC concepts, HTML/CSS responsive layouts, and Vagrant environment setup. Some of the project highlights are:

- User authentication
- Multi-list support
- Responsive design with Bootstrap
